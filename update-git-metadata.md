Update the dataset
==================

The PInSoRo dataset is regularly updated with refined annotations and other
meta-data.  Once you have [obtained the dataset](get-dataset), we recommend you
to update it to its latest version.

To do so, [download the latest version of the dataset
metadata](https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox/dataset/archive/master.zip)
from the dataset's GitHub repository, open the archive, and extract the content
of the `dataset-master/` folder into your existing dataset. When asked by your
operating system, click on *Replace all* or *Overwrite all* to update the files.

You might want to repeat this procedure every so often (or [everytime commits of
interest](https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox/dataset/commits/master) are added to the repository).

Alternatively, you can use `git` and the [public GIT
repository](https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox/dataset/) of the dataset to keep
your dataset up-to-date.


Using the dataset

Once you have obtained the dataset and updated it, check
[how to get started](https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox/dataset) with it.
