We detail hereafter the coding scheme.

### Task Engagement

| Construct             | Details                                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| goal-oriented         | purposeful play, implicit action planning, structured play             |
| aimless               | unstructured play, silly play                                          |
| adult seeking         | ask question, seek approval                                            |
| no play               | does not perform any obvious activity                                  |

Note that *structured* play might or might no be be on topic: a structured
activity unrelated to the offered touchscreen/drawing activity should still be
labelled as *goal-oriented*.

### Social Engagement

| passive               |                                                                           |
