The **PInSoRo Dataset** (also called _Freeplay Sandbox dataset_) is a large (120
children, 45h+ of RGB-D video recordings), open-data dataset of chid-child and
child-robot social interactions.

These interactions are recorded during little-constrained **free play**
episodes. They emcompass a rich and diverse set of social behaviours.
