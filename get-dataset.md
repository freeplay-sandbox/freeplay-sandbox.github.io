How to get the dataset
======================

For legal and ethical reasons, the dataset is only available to **academics**.

The dataset exists in two flavours:

- the anonymised version, **with no video streams**, that can be freely
  downloaded from the [Zenodo platform](https://zenodo.org/record/1043507) (7.2GB
  compressed). Once downloaded, unzip it somewhere and [follow these
  instructions](update-git-metadata) **to update the dataset with the latest
  meta-data**.

- the full dataset, **including raw video streams**, can be obtained after
  getting suitable **ethical clearance from your university ethics committee**.
  Due to the size of the full dataset (several terabytes), we share this version
  by shipping to you an harddrive with the data. See the **[Application
  procedure](application)**.

Besides, the **meta-data of the dataset** (demographics, details of the
recordings), as well as the **video annotations**, are stored and maintained as
[a public GIT repository](https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox/dataset/).


Once you have obtained the dataset and [updated it](update-git-metadata), check
[how to get started](https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox/dataset) with it.
